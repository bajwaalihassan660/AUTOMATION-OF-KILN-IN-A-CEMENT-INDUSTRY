# AUTOMATION-OF-KILN-IN-A-CEMENT-INDUSTRY
AUTOMATION OF KILN IN A CEMENT INDUSTRY USING LADDER LOGIC ON CX SIMULATOR AND CX DESIGNER
I automated the kiln operations in a cement industry using ladder logic programming on CX-Simulator and CX-Designer. This project involved developing a control system to monitor and manage various aspects of the kiln process efficiently. Using CX-Simulator, I programmed PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) with ladder logic to control critical parameters such as temperature and pressure. CX-Designer was used to create an HMI (Human-Machine Interface) to visualize and interact with these parameters, enabling operators to make informed decisions and ensure efficient kiln operation.

Skills Gained:

Ladder Logic Programming for PLCs on CX-Simulator
HMI Design and Implementation using CX-Designer
Integration and Calibration of Sensors
Process Automation in the Cement Industry
Real-time Data Monitoring and Control
Practical Experience in Industrial Automation
